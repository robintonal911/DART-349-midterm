How to unf*ck america
    </h1>
</header>
<h3>  Intro - why are we so f*cking angry?!?!?</h3>
<p>
  

    Beyond a seemingly never ending media shit-storm of doom and of the portrayals of a future that seems to be dimming every second, America’s very identity is in crisis. People and politicians aren’t solving problems, multinational conglomerates and monopolies are more powerful than ever, along with the ever increasing rates of socio-economic inequality and poverty. It doesn’t only seem that the world’s most powerful country is now wavering in the face of new global superpowers, but its own people can’t afford homes, are becoming apathetic to each other, and can’t even live together peacefully because they are so profoundly entrenched in their political beliefs, at some points putting the country on the brink of what felt like an impending civil war.
    </p><p>
        But you already knew that. And gloom and doom is cool and all, but you’ve heard it a billion times. Beyond the issues themselves, mass media rarely explores the underlying explanations for this state of limbo we’re in, and in many ways, that wouldn’t be in its best interest, because it plays a big role in our being in it. And why would a profitable system question itself if it would put its credibility at risk? It’s played a major role this broad, rising anger from within American society. 

        
    </p><p class="i">

        Same for reps from 17% to 52%
        
        (pew research, 2014), (pew research, 2021).        
    </p><p>
        Regardless of how we personally feel, there’s valid reasons for this broad underlying social anger. Basically speaking, our current political and media system economically thrives on your ability to hate the opposing side, and it’s gotten really good at triggering all of us. Yes, there are definitely very valid reasons for your anger, and you are far from alone in feeling it. The rest of the country feels it too. But when we move through life with that anger, we carry the mental brunt of it wherever we go. It adds mental weight and it slows us down in every aspect of life and literally reduces our IQs (Jung and Shin, 2019). This feeling is actively making our lives worse in more ways than one and we could actually find a way to change that if we ask ourselves the right questions. 
        Maybe that isn’t what you want, which is also understandable given the current state of the country, but at least these concepts will provide you with different ways to consider how you feel about your own ideas.
        
    </p><p class="i">

        For example: enter mini-game 1

        Intro screen presented with 2 opposing teams: broccoli and eggplant (could be changed). Large red flashing letters once team is picked of “xxx is your team! You need to defend your team no matter what!”
        
        Quiz 1: Pick your favorite tweet - 4 tweets are presented. Each wrong answer removes 10 points, while one right answer adds 50 points (because you have picked a side, implication is that the only right answer is that which serves your cause)
        
        Informational tweet
        Emotional tweet about the opposite side
        Entertainment tweet
        Inquisitive tweet (poll)
        
        Correct answer: 2
        
    </p><p>
        Of all the different types of tweets that get promoted, emotion based tweets tend to get much greater algorithmic promotion. And of those emotional types of content, major emphasis was placed on anger (Milli, 2023). And it’s not random that we get shown content that makes us angry. Twitter isn’t the only media hub like this. Many traditional news and media organizations have been leaning into more polarizing and angering stances over the past few years for one specific reason: it’s super profitable for them. 
</p><p>
    Of all emotions, anger is one that increases stress levels and effectively short circuits our ability to think critically (Blair, 2011). In the context of social media, this means it tends to make us engage more and spend more time on the service, which in turn makes them more money (because we see more ads), and think a lot less critically about the information we’re being fed. They are literally financially incentivized to promote content that makes us feel more anger and hate, actively dividing society in the process and worsening our lives. 
    That’s why we need to understand the ways we as individuals can try to make things better for ourselves and consequently those around us by trying to reduce this externally inflicted anger. Through understanding the fundamental societal and human evolutions that are at the root of many of these issues, we’re going to try to see how we can think more critically in times of ever-increasing societal non-discourse.
    
</p><h3>
1 - changes in how knowledge is produced and consumed
</h3><p class="i">
Quiz 2

A tweet talking about how big eggplant/big broccoli industry is controlling government (in factual seeming manner) is shown with its poster’s information hidden. We have to guess if it was posted by an expert/journalist, or if it was posted by a regular average user. (it was posted by a regular user, with X community notes saying that it is fake information, and after seeing it for a few seconds the community notes then get drawn over/illegible (done by members of your team))
</p><p>
    The fact that we lack the original poster’s information changes the very nature of the tweet: different people have different incentives to post different things, and without that information, we’re unsure of the validity of it. 
    A widespread argument you’ll see online is that we now live in a post truth world: through social media and traditional media, informational platforms act as bubbles where you only hear things that further confirm your beliefs, and this leads people to have different opinions on what truth is on a given topic. 
    In terms of relative importance, the journalist’s post is equally visually prominent to that of your co-worker’s friend that you met once at that weird party you went to that one time, or to that of an advertisement. Whereas traditional media placed strong emphasis on empirically validated experts in terms of their ability to express ideas and diffuse knowledge, Social media portrays all posts with equality: the user is not only a consumer of knowledge and information, but simultaneously a producer of one.
    
</p><p class="i"> 
Minigame 3

User is prompted to type a completely short non-sensical response to a given statement (presumably about how our own team has done something wrong). Once they hit enter, their text shows up as a quote tweet to the opposite team’s institutional agency eg: the National Eggplant Association.
</p><p>
    This change in how knowledge is produced and shared leads into a fundamental shift in how we consume information. The relative equality of importance of expert (or traditional knowledge producers) perspectives against the lay-person’s on a given topic – with the seemingly-infinite amount of data available and their open accessibility to most members of the general public – leads to a situation where the former’s perspectives aren’t seen as unequivocally true in the way they used to be (Malcolm, 2021). These factors are part of the reasons why our collective trust in experts has been eroded, and the prominence of (or alternative truths), and also explains the loss of shame in the face of being proved wrong publicly from politicians and other public figures.

    But what does this actually mean to how our society operates?
</p><h3>


2 - The death of reason or the fuel of polarization
</h3><p class="i">
Minigame 1

You have to put either eggplants or broccolis in a fire. Once they’re all in you gain 100 points. If you put a member of your team, you lose 10 points per member. There are also other vegetables and fruit and burning them will lose you 0 points each (externals opposing side don’t matter= implication).
</p><p>
    Because of the wealth of information available to all of us at all times, most people tend to be informed and have a specific stance on any given issue.
    But in most debates, beyond trying to prove we’re right or trying to persuade the opposing side, many of us resort to anger because no amount of talking will lead to any change in the way that people think, or if it does, it’s very superficial change and would only come in passing in a future conversation.     
</p><p>
The fundamental underlying reason is that we now are a society of opinions.
</p><p class="i">
quiz 3

Q: Out of the options shown below, which one do you think corresponds to the definition of an opinion?

A judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.
a particular attitude or way of considering a matter.

Correct answer, definition 1

</p><p>
    As surprising as it may be, definition 2 is that of a viewpoint – akin to a perspective. This shows us that opinion, contrary to a perspective, is a lot more like a belief – something that is irrational and profoundly based in emotion and identity. It therefore makes little to no sense to debate beliefs: There is a virtually non-existent chance that you will change someone’s mind on their beliefs. The tenants of human identity are founded in these beliefs, and they fuel our moral compass.

</p><p>
    But yet, when we try to have a conversation with one another, we ask each other what our opinions are. Not only that, most of the social media is focused on pushing the user to either take a stance or double down on one we already have through feeding us more radical content each time:

</p><p>
“Significant division can undermine confidence in democracy or democratic institutions and lead to “affective polarization,” when citizens begin to view each other more as enemies than legitimate opposition.”
– Associated Press, David Klepper
</p><p>
    Instead of trying to understand each other and have meaningful dialogue, we now want people on the opposite side of our issue to lose, seeing them as enemies and leading to their dehumanization (Harel, 2020) due to their beliefs putting into question your beliefs thus putting into question your identity, and therefore making them the enemy.

</p><p>
    This leads to a blending of opinion and truth: opinions – which are beliefs as explained earlier – are collectively agreed upon and lead to the creation of the ingroup and outgroup – an us vs. them situation (Malcolm, 2021). The consequences are that clan-like behavior becomes natural in such a context, and rationale and reason are for the most part forgotten, therefore further amplifying anger and polarization.
    Now that we have explored in detail what is a post-truth society and why America is in its current state, how can we actually bring about meaningful change?
    
</p><h3>
3 - Unfucking the country

</h3><p class="i">

animation - Frameworks

Concept is - 2 funnels are put side by side, and both come to the same result - opposing side is evil. Corresponding imagery is added.
</p><p>
    Mental frameworks are what drives us to feel and think a certain way. But every framework also has an end goal of its own, sometimes motivated by ideology, sometimes by beliefs, sometimes by profit. Larger frameworks operate as funnels, and can go to great lengths to make themselves particularly attractive if they have a financial or power-based incentive behind them. In the case of America and the political process, there are many incentives that express themselves in many many ways, and on either side they are conducive to one thing: making the other side the evil enemy, instead of actually ensuring the good of the people. And through this hatred, we stop actually considering people as people. Hate is actually the most powerful vector for dehumanization (Mendez, 2023). We don’t care about what the ideas are about because it’s not what matters anymore.

</p><p>
    From the start of this website, you were given a choice. You had to pick a side. Throughout it, you didn’t have a choice but to antagonize and attack the opposing side, and were rewarded for it. In real life, the same thing happens. We are not only encouraged to pick a side and attack the opposing side through example, but we are also rewarded socially through validation of our biases via our social filter bubbles. Instead of asking ourselves why we’re attacking, we’re doing so because we picked a side today, yesterday, years ago, as a child. That side isn’t only who we agree with. It’s who we are, and we’re going to stick to it, like a football team. But contrary to sports, politics is much more than a local community that irrationally vouches for their side regardless of their chances against the opposition. Politics is about ideas, policies, and wealth distribution. Politics is in many ways the most powerful practice we know of, because it can dictate to all other practices how to behave, and why. Whatever your industry is, politics controls it in one way or another. 
</p><p>
    So detaching ourselves from our side, even if we identify with its ideas a lot more meaningfully, enables us to reduce how important our emotional filter is: decoupling our identity from our ideas helps us not only understand what we actually think on the topic, but also perceive the deeper incentives behind the line being held. We are fed huge amounts of information every day, and we simply don’t have the time to filter through and check various sources on a given topic, and it seems simpler to take our sources at face value. But at the very end of the day, everyone – the people on our side and the opposing side – have HUGE incentives in believing that your side only speaks TRUTH. Let’s put this in crude terms:
</p><p>
    If you’re a democrat, you might think that republicans are not only irrational, misled and corrupted people but also that they’re trying to take away your rights. You may think your side may have some flaws, yes, but you’re far better than the other team, and that’s what matters.
</p><p>
    If you’re a republican, you might think democrats are not only unreasonable, brainwashed, and morally bankrupt people but also that they’re trying to take away your rights. You may think they're profoundly evil, and even though your side isn’t always perfect, it’s the only thing ensuring things don’t go to absolute pandemonium.
</p><p>
    The thing is, both of those descriptions could be inverted, and they would still be perfectly  applicable. And the thing is, if both sides keep on going down deeper into these beliefs, where in the world does this end? When do we find a point of discussion and resolution? 
    </p><p>
    If you don’t believe that there is a way for us to find that solution, I beg you to reconsider. The people running both parties need either side to feel this way so that they can keep on being elected: “If democrats get elected, it means the death of the american way of life the way we’ve known it!”, or “If republicans get elected, it’ll be the death of democracy!” (explosions behind both quptes)
</p><p> 
    And in a way, both sides are speaking truth, but within their frameworks. These frameworks of thought are meant to keep us boxed into these mindsets, because it helps both sides for you to hate the opposite side: your side wins because they have someone that will vouch for them no matter what, and the opposing side has your hate as fuel to strengthen their own base in an emotional way. The Democratic and Republican parties want you to hate the opposite side. Even though you may feel that your side is out for your best interests, it isn’t: it's out for their own best interest. Every time they can use emotion to get you more invested in a more irrational way, using it to make you agree with ideas you might not actually morally align with. And also, it completely eliminates the desire for a third, or fourth political party, consolidating their power.
    
</p><p> 
     Don’t get me wrong, we still need emotion in some ways – it’s an essential part of how we construct our ideas and our identity, and is a fundamental component of debate and human dialogue – rather,  we need to significantly reduce how much we rely on it. When we talk about politics, the question should never be How do you feel about this?, but rather what do you think about this. Instead of focusing on our emotional knee-jerk reaction, we can attempt to actually think about the ideas that we’re faced with and challenge them in a thought-out way, and try to understand the dissimulated motives behind those leading the conversation. 
    </p><p>  
    It also can actually enable you to see how much your moral values actually align with the side you feel closer to, and vice versa – are these ideas representative of how I lead my life, how I wish to lead my life? If we start to reason more than we react, we can become a lot more aware of the intentions of those on our team and the other, but also more considerate of ideas and propositions of the other side. Although that prospect might not seem attractive to you, these are people that hold the same power as you through their votes: If you just see them as another one of them, you’ll become cynical and jaded just like everyone else. Does cynicism seem like a meaningful way to lead our lives? That’s for you to answer. But through greater empathy, we can re-humanize those around us, that we’ve grown up with, that we live with, that we love. Finding that empathy is crucial to leading a better life, but also living in a more meaningful society that actually cares about creating a better world for its members, and not just saying it does.
</p><p>
    Hate can only do so much for your life. Just try to think about the information you receive, it might actually make the world a better place for you and others.
