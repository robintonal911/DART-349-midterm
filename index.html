How to unf*ck america
    </h1>

  <h2>
    the main goal of this research paper was twofold. First, it aimed to establish the tenants of polarization in america through the exploration of post-truth societies as a concept that defines  most of the dialogue occuring from within society. The second goal is to establish a information delivery system that not only engages the reader but puts them in a position where they have to think about the material, about their personal situation in an effort to bring greater change. Complex material can be easily forgotten and can go in one ear as quickly as it leaves the next. What matters is making sure the information is made accessible but also is presented in a way that outlines how valuable it is. The following options will lead you to the different parts of the website.
